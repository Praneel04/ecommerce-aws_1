# Step 4: AWS Cognito Authentication üîê

## Overview
Step 4 replaces mock authentication with **real AWS Cognito User Pools**, implementing secure user management with buyer/seller roles, OAuth integration, and protected API endpoints.

## üéØ What We'll Accomplish

### 1. AWS Cognito User Pools
- **User registration** with email verification
- **Login/logout** with secure JWT tokens
- **Password reset** and account recovery
- **Multi-factor authentication** (optional)

### 2. Role-Based Access Control
- **Buyer role**: Browse products, manage cart, place orders
- **Seller role**: Manage products, view sales, access dashboard
- **Admin role**: Full system access
- **Custom attributes** for user profiles

### 3. Frontend Integration
- **Cognito SDK** integration in React
- **Protected routes** based on authentication status
- **Role-based UI** components
- **Token management** and automatic refresh

### 4. Backend Security
- **JWT token validation** in Lambda functions
- **Role-based API access** control
- **User context** in all API calls
- **Secure user data** handling

## üõ†Ô∏è Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Cognito Infrastructure
1. Create Cognito User Pool
2. Configure App Client
3. Set up custom attributes for roles
4. Deploy CloudFormation template

### Phase 2: Frontend Authentication
1. Install AWS Amplify/Cognito SDK
2. Replace mock auth with Cognito
3. Add registration/login forms
4. Implement protected routes

### Phase 3: Backend Integration
1. Add JWT validation to Lambda functions
2. Extract user info from tokens
3. Implement role-based access control
4. Update API responses with user context

### Phase 4: Role Management
1. User registration with role selection
2. Admin interface for role management
3. Seller dashboard preparation
4. Buyer-specific features

Let's begin! üöÄ
